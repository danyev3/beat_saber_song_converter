# Beat Saber Song Converter
An executable to... well... _convert Beat Saber songs_?\
You can use this to change the names of your PC song's folders to use your song library on Quest!\
You can also convert from Quest to PC in case you like your songs folder to look nice and tidy.

### Installation
Just download the latest `BSSC.exe` from the realease tab and run it!\
Windows may warn you about the file being a virus or stright up delete it when you try to run it, to prevent this, you can temporarily disable Windows Defender's Real Time Protection.

If you think the program is a virus, **don't use it**. It's open source and the code is very simple and filled to the brim with comments to make it easier to read. The reason Windows flags it is because it's not signed with a certificate, and signing an executable is _extremely_ expensive.

### How to use BSSC
Once you run BSSC you'll be greeted with a very simple GUI, hit the `Select the custom songs folder` button and select your custom songs folder (The folder must be on your PC, not on your Quest).\
Once you selected a folder, the program will tell you how many PC songs and how many Quest songs it has detected, from here, just hit the `Convert to Quest` button or the `Convert to PC` button to convert all your songs!

There is also a third `Unknown format songs` label that will tell you how many songs the program found that don't follow the Quest or PC naming scheme.\
If you also want to convert these `Unknown format songs` just hit the checkbox next to the label and then one of the convert buttons.\

Converting to Quest is very quick, doesn't require internet access and is a required step to use your PC library on Quest.\

Converting to PC on the other end is very slow and requires an internet connection, this isn't something I can fix as I am limited by the BeatSaver API.\
If you don't really want to wait to convert your Quest songs to PC... just don't! PC Beat Saber doesn't care how your custom song folders are named (but converting them makes it much easier to know which song is which)
