# Beat Saber Song Converter
An executable to... well... _convert Beat Saber songs_?\
You can use this to change the names of your PC song's folders to use your song library on Quest!\
You can also convert from Quest to PC in case you like your songs folder to look nice and tidy but PC Beat Saber doesn't actually care what the song folders are called.\
Also going from Quest to PC **requires** internet access, going from PC to Quest doesn't.

I'll put a tutorial now here when the thing works, I promise. ~~Maybe.~~
