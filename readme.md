Beat Saber Song Converter
An executable to... well... convert songs?
You can use this to change the names of your PC song's folders to use your current song library on Quest!
You can also convert from Quest to PC in case your songs folder to look nice and tidy but PC beat saber doesn't actually care what the song folders are called.
Also going from Quest to PC requires internet access, going from PC to Quest doesn't.
